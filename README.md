# NetAssistant
A network debugging assistant based on Qt GUI. I fork this from another repo and compile it under Qt6. As the original porject is compiled under Qt5, a little change is needed. 

## Features:
1. UDP；
2. TCP client；
3. TCP server；
4. File transfer;
5. Group chat mode；
6. Multi-language;
